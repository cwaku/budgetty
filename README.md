# Budgetty

> A mobile web application where you can manage your budget: you have a list of transactions associated with a category, so that you can see how much money you spent and on what.
## Project requirements

## Built With

- css framework: Tailwind rails

- Major languages: Rails, Ruby

- Technologies used: [Rubocop](https://rubocop.org/)


### Prerequisites

- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/)
- [Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).

### Setup
- Install gems with:
- ` bundle install`
- ` NPM install`
- Setup database with
- `rails db:create`
- `rails db:migrate`

### Usage

Note: Confirm that you can run `Procfile.dev` to use `./bin/dev`. Else if you can't run it, run `./bin/rails server` but that also won't build the Tailwindcss.

- run: ` git clone https://github.com/cwaku/budgetty.git `
- connect to postgresql with: ` psql -U postgres `
- run: ` ./bin/dev ` to connect to the server
- Open http://localhost:3000/ in your browser.
